# Research Interests

- EEG/MEG Signal Processing (filter banks, spatial filters, source imaging)
- Brain窶鼎omputer Interfaces (SSVEP, MI, ECoG-based speech decoding)
- Foundation Models for Biosignals (self-supervised pretraining, multi-modal learning)
- Human窶鄭nimal窶鄭I Interaction (HAI^2)
- Medical AI Platforms and Multi-center Data Sharing (privacy-preserving learning)

## Ongoing directions
- Scalable EEG foundation models for cross-dataset generalization
- ECoG-based speech BCI with LLM integration
- Robust biomarkers for epilepsy and cognitive state monitoring
